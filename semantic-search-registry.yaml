    requirement_level:
      conditionally_required: If the operation resulted in an error
    note: |
      The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

      When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
      canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

      Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

      The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
      Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
      should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
      additional filters are applied.

      If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

      If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
      it's RECOMMENDED to:

      - Use a domain-specific attribute
      - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
